# Spond - what is it?
Spond is a team communication app, commonly used by sports teams, coaches to communicate with their teams in a private and secure manner.

# Why Spond?
This will allow members of the league to directly communicate with one another without having to publish email and phone lists.  It will allow us to communicate changes directly to the league as well as allow each match to post a record of the results.

# I'm old school and don't do apps on a smartphone
